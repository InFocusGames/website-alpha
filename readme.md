### Changelog

What follows is a summary of some of the major changes/milestones the site has undergone. Of course, the full nitty-gritty could always be told through git history. This is just a more user-friendly rundown of the key stuff:

<ul>
  <li>2018-03-15: Pushed redesign based on new version of Desmond, based on Boostrap 4.0.</li>
  <li>2018-02-22: Migrated blog to WordPress.com hosting. Static pages still self-hosted. Point of this is to give greater flexibility to experiment with certain server-side tools, while leaving basic functionality to someone else.</li>
  <li>2018-01-028: First commit of website code to GitHub</li>
  <li>2017-07-20: "Hello world" blog post published. At this point, site is running on a self-hosted instance of WordPress.</li>  
  <li>2017-07-13: Prototype version of Indizr email newsletter goes out to seven recipients. Setup/development of fuller website is underway.</li>
</ul>
